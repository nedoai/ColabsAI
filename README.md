# Project "Character Guessing Game" - ColabsAI

## Project Description

The "ColabsAI" is a text-based interactive game where players try to guess characters. You can load your characters and traits in characters.json

## Key Components of the Project

### 1. Character Database

For the project, you'll need a character. The database is JSON. It should include the following information for each character:

- Character's name
- Character's description
- Photo URL
- Traits

### 2. Decision Tree

The decision tree should be constructed based on the traits. Each answer should lead the player to the next question or a specific character. This decision tree defines the game's logic and makes it engaging.

## How to Use

1. Run the "train.py" application from your command line for train-save OR Run the "test_with_train_in_code.py" for training-algorithm
2. If you choice train-save - Run "test_with_already_trained.py"
3. Good luck guessing the characters! :)

## Used in Code

- Programming Language: Python
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Python's built-in libraries for handling command-line input and output.
- Character Database: JSON
